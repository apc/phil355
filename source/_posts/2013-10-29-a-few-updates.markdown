First, the [reading schedule](http://perezcarballo.org/phil355/readings/) has been updated. Let me know if you have any questions about that. 

Second, the second exam will take place on **Tuesday 11/19** (and not on Thursday 11/14, as originally planned). I will update the [course calendar](http://perezcarballo.org/phil355/calendar/) accordingly. 

Third, I am going to try an experiment. For the next few meetings, I will put up the slides for each class on the [Moodle website](https://moodle.umass.edu/course/view.php?id=9579). This will allow you to review them after class in case you need to. The slides from today's class are available [here](https://moodle.umass.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=380263).
