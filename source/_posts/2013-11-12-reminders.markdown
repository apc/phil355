A few things: 

- The second exam is on Tuesday, 11/19. The exam will have the same structure as the first exam. I will announce four essay questions, from which I will choose one, on Thursday. 
- If you have not done so, I recommend you re-read Lewis' '[Mad Pain and Martian Pain](https://www.dropbox.com/s/huqdbi4q67mziab/Lewis_MPMP.pdf)'. 
- For Thursday, please read Block's 'Troubles with Functionalism' (Chalmers).
