First: following up on our discussion last Thursday, here is Chomsky's [review](http://cogprints.org/1148/) of B. F. Skinner's [*Verbal Behavior*](http://umass.worldcat.org/oclc/222696). 

Second: there was a typo on the [readings](http://perezcarballo.org/phil355/readings/) for next week. It's been fixed now. If you tried to look for a section titled 'What Does ''Identity'' Mean?' in chapter 3 of Kim's book, you probably realized that there was a typo. But for the record: **all readings from Kim's book for next week are from chapter 4.**
