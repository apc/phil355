We are a little behind relative to the original reading schedule. So, for this coming Thursday, you should just reread the material assigned for today. In other words, here are the *readings for Thursday*: 

- Descartes, excerpts from *The Passions of the Soul*. (Chalmers).
- Smullyan, 'An Unfortunate Dualist'. (Chalmers)
- Kim, chapter 2, read until the end of the section titled 'Princess Elisabeth against Descartes'. 

I will update the reading schedule shortly.
