There's a [new quiz](https://moodle.umass.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=383090) for you to take on the [Moodle site](https://moodle.umass.edu/course/view.php?id=9579). Make sure you re-read Dretske's paper before taking it. You will have 20 minutes to complete the quiz. You have until Friday at 5pm to complete it.

Also, on Thursday we will finish up our discussion of Dretske before moving on to discuss the [assigned reading](http://perezcarballo.org/phil355/readings/) for that day.
